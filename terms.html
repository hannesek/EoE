        <h1>Studio's Terms and Policies for Booking a Tattoo Session</h1>

        <h2>Booking Fee</h2>
        <p>A non-refundable booking fee is required to secure an appointment. This fee will be deducted from the total cost of the tattoo on the day of the appointment.</p>

        <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>Clients must provide a minimum notice period for cancellations (e.g., 48 hours) to reschedule without losing their booking fee. Late cancellations may result in forfeiture of the booking fee.</p>

        <h2>Rescheduling</h2>
        <p>Clients can reschedule their appointment within a reasonable time frame without additional charges. Excessive rescheduling may require a new booking fee.</p>

        <h2>Design Changes</h2>
        <p>Significant changes to the tattoo design must be communicated well in advance of the appointment. Last-minute design changes may result in rescheduling or additional charges.</p>

        <h2>Arrival Time</h2>
        <p>Clients are expected to arrive on time for their appointment. Late arrivals may result in a shortened session or rescheduling.</p>

        <h2>Age Requirement</h2>
        <p>Clients must be of legal age to get a tattoo. Valid government-issued identification is required for verification.</p>

        <h2>Health Considerations</h2>
        <p>Clients should disclose any health conditions, allergies, or medications that may affect the tattooing process. The studio reserves the right to refuse service based on health concerns.</p>

        <h2>Under the Influence</h2>
        <p>Clients must not be under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the tattoo session. The studio reserves the right to refuse service in such cases.</p>

        <h2>Photography and Social Media</h2>
        <p>The studio may take photographs of the completed tattoo for portfolio and promotional purposes. Clients can discuss any privacy concerns with their artist.</p>

        <h2>Touch-Up Policy</h2>
        <p>The studio may offer a complimentary touch-up session within a specified period (e.g., 6 weeks) after the initial appointment. After this period, touch-ups may be subject to additional charges.</p>

        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <p>The remaining balance of the tattoo must be paid in full on the day of the appointment. Cash or specified payment methods are accepted.</p>

        <h2>Courtesy and Respect</h2>
        <p>Both clients and studio staff are expected to treat each other with respect and courtesy. Any disrespectful behavior may result in refusal of service.</p>

        <h2>Follow Aftercare Instructions</h2>
        <p>Clients must follow the provided aftercare instructions to ensure proper healing of the tattoo. Failure to do so may affect the outcome, and touch-ups may not be provided free of charge.</p>

        <h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The studio is not liable for any allergic reactions, infections, or complications that may arise post-tattoo, provided proper aftercare instructions are followed.</p>
